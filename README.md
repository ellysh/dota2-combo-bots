# Dota 2 Combo Bots 0.1 version

**This project is still in prototyping and developing stage.**

These are bots for Dota 2 and a toolkit to configure them.

## Why this project appeared?

Dota has default bots that are fit excellent for new players training. But they are too weak to compete with more experienced players. Therefore, these players do not have reliable computer opponents, which allow them to train some tactics and ideas.

There are several well-known projects that suggest more powerful bots for experienced players. But most of them have some drawbacks that make them unreliable for daily Dota training.

The aim of this project is providing a reliable solution for experienced players training.

## Architecture

The main issue with any Dota bots is to transform knowledge from the game experts and pro players into the source code. The Combo Bots project has a solution to this issue.

The knowledge about the game is extracted from the source code into the Excel document, which is named "Database". Any player can edit this document and use generator script to produce Lua files. These files have the format, which can be read by the bot. Thus, we have a flexible mechanism to configure the bot and adapt it for your purposes.
